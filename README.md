# autonomous-boids-extended

This application simulates emergent behaviour that resembles the flocking behaviour of birds or other animals. Originally developed by Craig Reynolds in 1987 , the original simulation consisted of “boids” who were influenced by three forces: separation, cohesion, and alignment. These forces are determined by other boids in their range of vision. The implementation discussed in this report is based on a more recent version by Hartman and Benes  that introduced the concept of leadership. More specifically, boids have a scalar value determined by their position in the flock called “eccentricity”. This value is then used in conjunction with a measure of how close to the front of the flock a boid is to attempt a random chance at escape. When a boid escapes, it accelerates quickly to a top speed above other boids’ and escapes the flock, causing them to chase the escaping boid briefly, before it stops escaping and returns to a normal speed, and make it the flock’s “leader”.
